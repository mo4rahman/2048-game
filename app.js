// Some pesudo-code to get a general sense of what we need to do to get at least a functional and working mvp

// We will want to do majority of the work in JS first, and make sure we have the
// functionality down before we dive into CSS and HTML. However, we will start 
// with some basic CSS and HTML to at least visualize our game.


// Create Game board:
// Create a square board in the center of the page, with lines that divide the 
// board into a 4x4 grid of empty white space

// Create Tiles:
// Have each square in our game board grid have the ability to display a square
// tile for each square (we can change the color and number based on js events)

// Initializing game:
// Have 2 random squares in our grid be a tile of 2 with a color (all same 
// numbers should have the same color. every 2 will be beige, every 4 will be a 
// darker beige, etc).
//

// Events:
// Make JS listen for arrow key presses:
// (have to research, but I think there should be an option for a 'keydown' press
// or something like that)
// Also create arrow key buttons that when clicked, will have the same 
// functionality as when pressing respective arrow keys.
// Pressing a direction should have the tiles all shift the most they can in that
// direction (preferably with a sliding animation instead of just reappearing 
// where they should be and refresshing.)
